# Mastering-JavaScript-in-20-Days
GSG first learning sprint for the QA training 👩‍🏫

## Challenge Details ❔🧐 :
This is a challenge to learn and master Javascript in 20 days or less 🌝 . My goal is to improve my knowledge in javascript and gain a new understanding of the hidden inner details of the language 💡. I aim to improve my problem-solving skills with js and create new projects 💯. The online resources used to learn will be the courses on frontEnd Masters and certain coding challenges on freeCodeCamp. Each day I participate in the challenge I'll create a new daily readMe 📅,  and on that page, the details of what I learned on the given day will be posted. The links to all the daily readMe pages will also be added to this page below ⬇️. Any projects created for this challenge will also be linked to this page 👍.
